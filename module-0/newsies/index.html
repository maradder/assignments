    <h1><span>A</span>rdern reassures voters that Greens’ negotiating table will be a tiny, humiliating one</h1>
    <h5>16/10/2020 at 6:22 pm</h5>
    <p>In the final hours of the campaign, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has made a forceful appeal to the electorate not to be afraid of any Green Party influence on the next government, promising that a wealth tax would <span class="larger bold red">“absolutely not”</span> be on the negotiating table in a Labour-Green coalition, and that the negotiating table itself would be tiny, humiliating, and have chairs made for children.</p>
    <p>“I said it last night, I’ve been saying it for two weeks, and I’ll say it again,” Ardern told media today against the backdrop a thousand looming selfies. “Of course when you have for Labour you are voting for Labour Party policy, and that is a bottom line for me. I have said, that a wealth tax will not make it to any negotiating table. I have said that negotiating table will be very small, some might even describe it as tiny in a frankly humiliating way, and thus only able to hold a small range of proposals, which we will explore, but explore with our principles firmly in mind.</p>

    <p>“When you have a coalition, you have a big partner, and you have a small partner, and it is purely desperate and scaremongering for certain people to suggest otherwise. When you are the big partner, you get the most say in what we do. You get normal size chairs, water to drink, and lunch.<span class="bold red"> If you are the small partner, you simply must accept that.</span>”</p>
    <p>Ardern became particularly fired up during last night’s TVNZ leaders debate, when opposition leader Judith Collins accused her of wanting to implement a wealth tax, saying that the Prime Minister “would if she could.”</p>
    <p>A number of people close to Ardern say she was “authentically upset” at Collins’ suggestion that her government would genuinely attempt “to do something.”</p>
